Good morning/Afternoon/evening,
I am satyam maheshwari, I m belongs to Gwalior, Mp,
I have done my schooling from J.c mills schools, gwalior, 
Currently, I am pursuing my bachelor's of technology in computer science and engineering at rgpv University bhopal, at the beginning of my college, I have learned some language such as, c, c++, python and right now, I have used are Docker, Terraform, Jenkins, CI/CD, Git, Git-hub,  on the other hand, I have used the AWS cloud and it's services such as , EC2, VPC, S3, Route 53, & so more....
Recently, I have done the training in DevOps or cloud from RR Technology institute, gwalior.
In my training journey, I got to know about , what is DevOps & why use DevOps  & what are the advantages of DevOps.
          So, basically DevOps is a set of practices & culture that is used to automate and integrate the process between Software development team and Operation team. 
It is used to Build, Shop & Deploy the product in order to increase the quality and the speed of Software Delivery.
          DevOps teams working are coloborately throughout the product life cycle. So basically DevOps is promoting Agile methodology as it is a way to manage a project by breaking down it into several phases through which we will deliver project in multiple sprint fir every sprint we will take client feedback which is a good practice, we know the DevOps is famous for automation and integration.
So, I have several type of tools such as Git as it is a distributed version control system use to track the history of the code and like their are different types of source code management tool such as Gitlab, GitHub, Bit-bucket but I have exposure on github. 
It is used to store the code in repositories and continuous deployment, i have used to jenkins tools, where I have build several pipelines. As git & jenkins are used for CI/CD, DevOps is also used provide containerisation by the help of Docker tools, I have used also Terraform tools used for infrastructure as a code that allows DevOps teams to automate infrastructure provisioning using reusable, shareable, human-readable configuration files.
